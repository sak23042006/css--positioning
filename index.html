        <h1>CYBER SECURITY</h1>
               -By Arun Kumar_S
      </pre>
      <p>
        Critical infrastructure security Critical infrastructure security
        protects the computer systems, applications, networks, data and digital
        assets that a society depends on for national security, economic health
        and public safety. In the United States the National Institute of
        Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a cybersecurity framework
        to help IT providers in this area, and the U.S. Department of Homeland
        Security’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
        provides additional guidance.<br />

        Network security Network security prevents unauthorized access to
        network resources, and detects and stops cyberattacks and network
        security breaches in progress—while at the same time ensuring that
        authorized users have secure access to the network resources they need,
        when they need them.<br />

        Endpoint security Endpoints—servers, desktops, laptops, mobile
        devices—remain the primary entry point for cyberattacks. Endpoint
        security protects these devices and their users against attacks, and
        also protects the network against adversaries who leverage endpoints to
        launch attacks.
        <br />
        Application security Application security protects applications running
        on-premises and in the cloud, preventing unauthorized access to and use
        of applications and related data, and preventing flaws or
        vulnerabilities in application design that hackers can use to infiltrate
        the network. Modern application development methods—i.e. DevOps and
        DevSecOps—build security and security testing into the development
        process. <br />

        Cloud security Cloud security secures an organization’s cloud-based
        services and assets—applications, data, storage, development tools,
        virtual servers and cloud infrastructure. Generally speaking, cloud
        security operates on the shared responsibility model: the cloud provider
        is responsible for securing the services they deliver and the
        infrastructure used to deliver them, while the customer is responsible
        for protecting their data, code and other assets they store or run in
        the cloud. The details vary depending on the cloud services used.
        <br />
        Information security Information security (InfoSec) pertains to
        protection of all an organization's important information—digital files
        and data, paper documents, physical media, even human speech—against
        unauthorized access, disclosure, use or alteration. Data security, the
        protection of digital information, is a subset of information security
        and the focus of most cybersecurity-related InfoSec measures.
        <br />
        Mobile security Mobile security encompasses a number of disciplines and
        technolgies specific to smartphones and mobile devices, including mobile
        application management (MAM) and enterprise mobility management (EMM).
        More recently, mobile security is available as part of unified endpoint
        management (UEM) solutions that enable configuration and security
        management for all endpoints—not just mobile devices but desktop,
        laptops, and more) from a single console.
